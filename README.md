# Arcade Button Controller with 7-segment display
### An Arduino-powered arcade controller for Unity

This is a mini-script with the purpose of converting an arcade button press into a serial message to be sent to Ardity, a group of assets for integrating Arduino and Unity.

You can download Ardity [here](https://github.com/DWilches/Ardity).

### Roadmap

The Arcade Button Controller works well with a single button, but I am looking forward to incorporating a few features and fixes for future builds.

In no particular order:
* Support for multiple arcade buttons, up to 64 individual inputs
* Support for individual control of each button via Unity serial communication
* Pretty flashing pattern during idle
* Incorporating a multi-digit 7-segment display that relays a count of the total number of presses from Unity
* Include electrical schematics
